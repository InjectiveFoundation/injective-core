# Join the Network

## Hardware Specification
Node operators should expect to provision one or more data center locations with redundant power, networking, firewalls, HSMs and servers.

The minimum hardware specifications are as follows, though they might rise as network usage increases:

```
6+ vCPU x64
32+ GB RAM
500 GB+ SSD
```

## Install `injectived` and `peggo`

See the [Injective chain releases repo](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/testnet/releases) for the most recent releases. Non-validator node operators do not need to install `peggo`.

```bash
wget https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/testnet/releases/download/v1.11.1-1685205489/linux-amd64.zip
unzip linux-amd64.zip
sudo mv peggo /usr/bin
sudo mv injectived /usr/bin
sudo mv libwasmvm.x86_64.so /usr/lib 
```

## Initialize a New Injective Chain Node

Before running the Injective Chain node, we need to initialize the chain as well as the node's genesis file:

```bash
# The argument <moniker> is the custom username of your node, it should be human-readable.
export MONIKER=<moniker>
# Injective Testnet has a chain-id of "injective-888"
injectived init $MONIKER --chain-id injective-888
```

Running the `init` command will create `injectived` default configuration files at `~/.injectived`.

## Prepare Configuration to Join Testnet

You should now update the default configuration with the Testnet's genesis file and application config file, as well as configure your persistent peers with seed nodes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/testnet.git

# copy genesis file to config directory
aws s3 cp s3://injective-snapshots/testnet/genesis.json . --no-sign-request
mv genesis.json ~/.injectived/config/

# copy config file to config directory
cp testnet/corfu/70001/app.toml  ~/.injectived/config/app.toml
cp testnet/corfu/70001/config.toml ~/.injectived/config/config.toml
```

You can also run verify the checksum of the genesis checksum - a4abe4e1f5511d4c2f821c1c05ecb44b493eec185c0eec13b1dcd03d36e1a779
```bash
sha256sum ~/.injectived/config/genesis.json
```

## Configure `systemd` Service for `injectived`

Edit the config at `/etc/systemd/system/injectived.service`:
```bash
[Unit]
  Description=injectived

[Service]
  WorkingDirectory=/usr/bin
  ExecStart=/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/injectived --log-level=error start'
  Type=simple
  Restart=always
  RestartSec=5
  User=root

[Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Starting and restarting the systemd service
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart injectived
sudo systemctl status injectived

# enable start on system boot
sudo systemctl enable injectived

# To check Logs
journalctl -u injectived -f
```

## Sync with the network
