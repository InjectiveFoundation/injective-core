title: Nodes for API Traders
---

API traders who wish to run their own node for enhanced performance should refer to the [Injective Exchange Service Setup Guide](https://injective.notion.site/Injective-Exchange-Service-Setup-Guide-7e59980634d54991862300670583d46a). This guide outlines the setup process for a core Injective node in addition to an Indexer service which is necessary for querying exchange data. Step 8 (Optionally Running the DEX Stack) can be skipped, as this is only needed for users looking to deploy an exchange front-end.
