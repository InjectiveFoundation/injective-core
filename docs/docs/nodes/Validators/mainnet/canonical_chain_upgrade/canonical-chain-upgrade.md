# Injective Canonical Chain Upgrade Instructions

 Nov 8th, 2021

 The following document describes the necessary steps involved that validators and full node operators must take in order to upgrade from the Injective Canary Chain to the Canonical Chain. The upgrade will take place via an on-chain software upgrade proposal passed by Injective governance. If passed, this proposal would commit the Injective Mainnet to halting the Canary Chain injectived application binary at approximately 14:00 UTC on Nov 8th and starting the application binary for the Injective Canonical Chain.

 Injective Canary Chain to the Canonical Chain upgrade follows [proposal #65](https://hub.injective.network/proposals/65)

Following a chain upgrade timeline, as a first step proccedd to Canonical chain release [10002-rc1](canonical-10002-rc1.md) upgrade.
