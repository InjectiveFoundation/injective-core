# inEVM

inEVM is the first-ever Ethereum Virtual Machine capable of achieving true composability across Injective and Ethereum. The inEVM network was developed as a collaboration between Injective and Caldera.

inEVM brings additional value to cross-chain dApps and allows applications to achieve true composability across multiple networks. It allows Ethereum developers to interact with the broader blockchain universe and to scale further. All dAppss are welcome to participate! (If you need an idea to start: AMM protocols, lending platforms, DEXs, yield farming and liquidity mining, staking, DAOs, insurance protocols, asset management tools, derivatives and synthetics, tokenization platforms).

Get started by following [the documentation](https://calderaxyz.gitbook.io/injective-documentation/getting-started/deploy-on-the-injective-evm-chain) and [resources](https://inevm.caldera.dev/)
