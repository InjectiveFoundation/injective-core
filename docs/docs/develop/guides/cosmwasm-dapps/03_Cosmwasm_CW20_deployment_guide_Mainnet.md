# CosmWasm Governance and Mainnet Deployment Guide


This guide will get you started with the governance process of deploying and instantiating CosmWasm smart contracts on Injective Mainnet.

## Submit a code upload proposal to Injective mainnet

In this section, you will learn how to submit a proposal and vote for it.

Injective network participants can propose smart contracts deployments and vote in governance to enable them. The `wasmd` authorization settings are by on-chain governance, which means deployment of a contract is completely determined by governance. Because of this, a governance proposal is the first step to uploading contracts to Injective mainnet.

Sample usage of injectived to start a governance proposal to upload code to the chain:

```bash
injectived tx wasm submit-proposal wasm-store artifacts/cw20_base.wasm
--title "Title of proposal - Upload contract" \
--description "Description of proposal" \
--instantiate-everybody true \
--deposit=1000000000000000000inj \
--run-as [inj_address] \
--gas=10000000 \
--chain-id=injective-888 \
--broadcast-mode=sync \
--yes \
--from [YOUR_KEY] \
--gas-prices=500000000inj
```

The command `injectived tx gov submit-proposal wasm-store` submits a wasm binary proposal. The code will be deployed if the proposal is approved by governance.

Letâ€™s go through two key flags `instantiate-everybody` and `instantiate-only-address`, which set instantiation permissions of the uploaded code. By default, everyone can instantiate the contract.

```bash
--instantiate-everybody boolean # Everybody can instantiate a contract from the code, optional
--instantiate-only-address string # Only this address can instantiate a contract instance from the code
```

## Contract Instantiation Governance

As mentioned above, contract instantiation permissions on Mainnet depend on the flags used when uploading the code. By default, it is set to permissionless, as we can verify on the genesis `wasmd` Injective setup:

``` json
"wasm": {
            "codes": [],
            "contracts": [],
            "gen_msgs": [],
            "params": {
                "code_upload_access": {
                    "address": "",
                    "permission": "Everybody"
                },
                "instantiate_default_permission": "Everybody"
            },
            "sequences": []
        }
```

Unless the contract has been uploaded with the flag `--instantiate-everybody false`, everybody can create new instances of that code.

The Injective Testnet is permissionless by default in order to allow developers to easily deploy contracts.

### Contract Instantiation Proposal

```bash
 injectived tx gov submit-proposal instantiate-contract [code_id_int64] [json_encoded_init_args] --label [text] --title [text] --description [text] --run-as [address] --admin [address,optional] --amount [coins,optional] [flags]
 ```

```bash
Flags:
  -a, --account-number uint      The account number of the signing account (offline mode only)
      --admin string             Address of an admin
      --amount string            Coins to send to the contract during instantiation
  -b, --broadcast-mode string    Transaction broadcasting mode (sync|async|block) (default "sync")
      --deposit string           Deposit of proposal
      --description string       Description of proposal
      --dry-run                  ignore the --gas flag and perform a simulation of a transaction, but dont broadcast it (when enabled, the local Keybase is not accessible)
      --fee-account string       Fee account pays fees for the transaction instead of deducting from the signer
      --fees string              Fees to pay along with transaction; eg: 10uatom
      --from string              Name or address of private key with which to sign
      --gas string               gas limit to set per-transaction; set to "auto" to calculate sufficient gas automatically (default 200000)
      --gas-adjustment float     adjustment factor to be multiplied against the estimate returned by the tx simulation; if the gas limit is set manually this flag is ignored  (default 1)
      --gas-prices string        Gas prices in decimal format to determine the transaction fee (e.g. 0.1uatom)
      --generate-only            Build an unsigned transaction and write it to STDOUT (when enabled, the local Keybase is not accessible)
  -h, --help                     help for instantiate-contract
      --keyring-backend string   Select keyrings backend (os|file|kwallet|pass|test|memory) (default "os")
      --keyring-dir string       The client Keyring directory; if omitted, the default 'home' directory will be used
      --label string             A human-readable name for this contract in lists
      --ledger                   Use a connected Ledger device
      --no-admin                 You must set this explicitly if you dont want an admin
      --node string              <host>:<port> to tendermint rpc interface for this chain (default "tcp://localhost:26657")
      --note string              Note to add a description to the transaction (previously --memo)
      --offline                  Offline mode (does not allow any online functionality
  -o, --output string            Output format (text|json) (default "json")
      --proposal string          Proposal file path (if this path is given, other proposal flags are ignored)
      --run-as string            The address that pays the init funds. It is the creator of the contract and passed to the contract as sender on proposal execution
  -s, --sequence uint            The sequence number of the signing account (offline mode only)
      --sign-mode string         Choose sign mode (direct|amino-json), this is an advanced feature
      --timeout-height uint      Set a block timeout height to prevent the tx from being committed past a certain height
      --title string             Title of proposal

  -y, --yes                      Skip tx broadcasting prompt confirmation
```

## Contract Migration

Migration is the process through which a given smart contract's code can be swapped out or 'upgraded'.

When instantiating a contract, there is an optional admin field that you can set. If it is left empty, the contract is immutable. If the admin is set (to an external account or governance contract), that account can trigger a migration. The admin can also reassign the admin role, or even make the contract fully immutable if desired. However, keep in mind that when migrating from an old contract to a new contract, the new contract needs to be aware of how the state was previously encoded.

A more detailed description of the technical aspects of migration can be found in the [CosmWasm migration documentation](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/smart-contracts/migration).
