# dApps on Injective

dApps on Injective are powered by CosmWasm smart contracts and popular frontend frameworks such as React or Vue.

CosmWasm is a novel smart contract platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem. You can learn more about CosmWasm [here](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/), or see the [CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/index.html) for a guide on creating CosmWasm smart contracts.
