# dApp Example: Build an Orderbook DEX on Injective

As an incentive mechanism to encourage exchanges to build on Injective and source trading activity, exchanges that originate orders into the shared orderbook of Injective's exchange protocol ([read more](../../modules/Injective/exchange/)) are rewarded with $\beta = 40\%$ of the trading fee from orders that they source. The exchange protocol implements a global minimum trading fee of $r_m=0.1\%$ for makers and $r_t=0.2\%$ for takers.

The goal of Injective's incentive mechanism is to allow exchanges competing amongst each other to provide a better user experience and to better serve users, broadening access to DeFi for users all around the world.

An exchange can easily set up a client (such as a UI on web or mobile) and an API provider.
